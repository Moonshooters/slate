# Introduction

Welcome to the Toofr Sales Hacking API! You can use our API to guess business emails, test emails, and extract prospects from webpages and our database.

We have language examples in Shell, Ruby, and Python. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

Every Toofr user has access to our API. API calls use credits in the same way that our web application use credits. For more information on how credits are used, view our [FAQ](https://www.toofr.com/faq).

To get an API key, first [register for a free Toofr account](https://www.toofr.com/registration). Check your email for a confirmation message, click through the link, and log in. Your API key is available on your [Account page](https://www.toofr.com/account).

If you run out of credits, you'll need to sign up for a [monthly plan](https://www.toofr.com/pricing) to get more. Currenty they start at just $19/mo.

Your API key is a long alphanumeric string that looks similar to this:

`e3eabc123ccabcd3efg233hij06b7031`

Keep your API key secure! If you don't, someone can use all of your credits for the month, and even send you into overage. You're responsible for all API usage.
